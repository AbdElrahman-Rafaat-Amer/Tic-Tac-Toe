# Tic Tac Toe Game (Android)
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for the Android platform. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Features
Two-player mode: Players can take turns playing against each other on the same device.
Interactive game board: The game board is displayed on the screen and players can tap on the spaces to make their moves.
Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won the game and displays a winning message.
Draw detection: If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game will be declared as a draw.
Restart option: After a game is finished, players have the option to restart and play again.

# Installation
After the game development is finished, I will provide guidance and share the link to download the game on Google Play

# Usage
Will be povided later.
